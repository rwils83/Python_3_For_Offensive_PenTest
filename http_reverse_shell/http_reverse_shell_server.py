 # 1. Yes, I know the # box is annoying to most. I like it. Deal             #
 # 2. There is a script following a tutorial from a Udemy course, with some  #
 #    needed changes (like he uses placeholder.txt for in the server file    #
 #    as the name to write the file to). Don't be picky, I wrote the shit for#
 #    fun and learning.                                                      #
 # 3. A big change from the course is the platform.system() additions. I work#
 #    on a linux machine. That being said, there are some things that don't  #
 #    import, like winreg. That is a windows only thing. So, if you plan to  #
 #    use this on a windows target, build on a windows machine or the        #
 #    script will break. I also recommend using pyinstaller to make the exe  #
 #    file. At the end of the day, read what the code says, you should be    #
 #    able to figure out what you need to do. Thanks, hope you enjoy!        #
